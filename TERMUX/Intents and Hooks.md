Termux is ale to catch several intents and execute shell scripts to act them:
- Sharing single files with Termux
Following handle will be executed: `~/bin/termux-file-editor`
- Opening in your popular editor by using a symbolic link:
```
ln -s $PREFIX/bin/nvim ~/bin/termux-file-editor
```
- Create a handle by creating a file and changing the access rights:
1. `nano ~/bin/termux-file-editor`
2. `chmod +x ~/bin/termux-file-editor`
- URL sharing available in common apps (e.g. Youtube).
Following handle will be executed: `~/bin/termux-url-opener`
- Sharing a URL to be downloaded.
You can handle incoming URL by editing the content.
-`yoursth-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4][height<=720]+bestaudio' --restrict-filenames -o '~/storage/downloads/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s' $1`
